# arena.nvim

`arena.nvim` is a **frecency**-based buffer switcher that allows you to hop between
files as fast as you can think! If you're tired of:

- Using a fuzzy-finder every time you want to switch to a file
- Persistent marks that you have to maintain yourself
- Feeling completely lost in projects with a lot of files

then the arena the perfect solution!
